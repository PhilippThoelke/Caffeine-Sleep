# immediate TODOs
- run single-trial SVM for longer duration, only NREM and REM
- rerun multi-feauture with 12 final features
- update manuscript
    - fix citations
    - rewrite stats- and singleML results section
    - add correlation (make sure to mention multiple coparison correction)
    - add section on criticality and E/I balance
    - mention age groups and their differences
    - add supplementary
- topomap colorbar updates
    - stats: coolwarm
    - singleML: white (50%) to green (max. acc.)
    - multiML: maybe "Reds" but try jet or viridis
    - correlations: some other diverging colormap, which is not "coolwarm"

# overview
- remove awake
- only show young group
    - mention middle-aged group at end of methods, results and discussion
    - include middle-aged results in supplementary
- split features into PSD and rest
    - remove PermEn and SpecPermEn
    - keep SpecEn, SampEn, SpecSampEn, DFA(-Hurst), 1/f, LZiv
- only keep LDA and SVM in single-feature approach
- single-trial single-feature ML in supplementary to support low sample-size stats
- link 1/f and DFA to E/I balance and criticality

    - also add a note on sleep quality: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.03.22275735v1.full.pdf
- rewrite statistics and single-feature ML results sections
- check if we want to use negative 1/f slope (check literature for 1/f difference reports)
- add a sentence on why it's important to look at only the young age group in the correlation
    - add sleep duration vs. age figure in supplementary

# figures
- Fig. 1: PSD results from stats, LDA, SVM (6x6 topomaps: 6 power bands by (3 analyses * 2 sleep stages)
- Fig. 2: remaining feature results from stats, LDA, SVM (6x6 topomaps: 6 features by (3 analyses * 2 sleep stages)
- Fig. 3: multi feature importance topomaps (vertical), next to horizontal bar plots (the colorful ones)
- Fig. 4: correlation results (6x4 topomaps: (6 PSD x 2 stages) + (6 remaining features x 2 stages))

# E/I balance and 1/f
- adenosine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter
- caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, therefore decreasing inhibition
    - increase in E/I ratio
- increased excitation relates to a flatter slope
    - shown here https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86993-9_11#Sec2
- flatter slope (in FOOOF) means smaller exponent
- we see that caffeine decreases 1/f in NREM and REM
    - during caffeine, slope if flatter
- therefore, we see that caffeine reduces inhibition and increases E/I
